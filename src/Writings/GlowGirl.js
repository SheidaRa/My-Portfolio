        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Glow Girl is a unique women's health website designed with confidentiality and accessibility in mind. With robust security features and multilingual translations, it ensures safer and more private access to information. Additionally, Glow Girl is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing users to download the website directly onto their devices. This is particularly valuable in cultures where discussing women's health topics can be challenging. The primary goal of Glow Girl is to empower women by providing a secure and convenient space for accessing essential health resources.</p>

        <h2>Key Steps in the Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
        <p>To create an effective and user-friendly women's health website, I began by researching existing platforms in the market:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Evaluated popular women's health websites and apps, analyzing their design, functionality, and user reviews to understand current trends and user expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> Identified common features that users appreciated and pinpointed gaps in the market, such as the need for enhanced security and multilingual support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept Exploration</h3>
        <p>I explored various design directions and functionalities to make Glow Girl both user-friendly and secure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wireframes and Sketches:</strong> Developed wireframes and sketches to visualize different design concepts, focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Prototypes:</strong> Created initial digital prototypes to test different layouts and features, gathering feedback from potential users to refine the design.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Main Design Decisions</h2>
        <h3>Confidentiality and Security Features</h3>
        <p>Ensuring user privacy and security was a top priority:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ambiguous App Logo:</strong> Designed an ambiguous app logo to prevent revealing the appâ€™s purpose, ensuring user privacy even if someone sees the app on their device.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Features:</strong> Implemented features like screen blackout on double-tap and auto-deleting browser history every minute to protect user confidentiality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>To make Glow Girl accessible to a broader audience, I focused on several key aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multilingual Support:</strong> Integrated multilingual translations to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds, ensuring they can access information in their preferred language.</li>
            <li><strong>PWA Functionality:</strong> Developed the site as a Progressive Web App, allowing users to download it directly onto their devices for offline access and improved privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Accessibility Features:</strong> Planned additional features like dark mode and increased font size to enhance accessibility for users with different needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As the main UX/UI designer and developer, I led the design and development process for Glow Girl during the two-day Hack the Gap hackathon. My responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience, including women of all ages, those prioritizing confidential health information, and women in culturally sensitive environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Wireframes and Prototypes:</strong> Created detailed wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma to visualize the user interface and interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Implemented the website using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and Progressive Web App technologies, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Initial Concepts</h3>
        <p>I explored initial concepts and ideas through a combination of paper wireframes and digital prototypes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paper Wireframes:</strong> Sketched out initial ideas to quickly iterate and refine design concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Prototypes:</strong> Developed digital prototypes using Figma to test and visualize the user interface and interactions. These prototypes helped identify potential usability issues early in the design process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
        <p>I created high-fidelity mockups to refine the visual design and layout:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Paid close attention to typography, spacing, and imagery to ensure a polished and cohesive aesthetic. The high-fidelity mockups included detailed representations of the website's interface, including navigation elements, content sections, and security features.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Incorporated interactive elements into the mockups to demonstrate the website's functionality, such as multilingual support and security features.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Conducted usability testing sessions to evaluate the website's design and user experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Testing Sessions:</strong> Engaged a diverse group of users to test the website, including college students and women in culturally sensitive environments. These sessions provided valuable insights into how users interacted with the website and their overall experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Collected feedback on usability, visual design, and overall satisfaction. Based on this feedback, I identified minor issues related to development and coding, which were addressed in subsequent iterations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Final Designs</h2>
        <p>Incorporated feedback from usability testing to refine the final designs. The website features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Access:</strong> Robust security features like screen blackout and auto-deleting browser history to protect user privacy.</li>
