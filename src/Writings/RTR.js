      {/* <h1>Project Overview: Rate Your Landlord Web Application</h1> */}

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The "Rate Your Landlord" website is a community-driven platform designed
        to empower renters by enabling them to share their experiences with
        rental properties. In a market where transparency and accountability are
        essential, this platform helps users make informed decisions about their
        rentals, fostering better relationships between landlords and tenants.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Steps in the Design Process</h2>

      <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
      <p>
        We initiated our project with a comprehensive analysis of existing
        competitors in the rental review market. Our findings highlighted
        several shortcomings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Outdated Design and Functionality:</strong> Many platforms
          featured outdated user interfaces and lacked modern design elements,
          making navigation cumbersome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Information:</strong> Existing platforms often
          provided insufficient details about properties, leading to a lack of
          trust and engagement from users.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To address these gaps, we aimed to create a platform with a more
        accessible structure for individual property listings and a
        user-friendly interface, ultimately enhancing usability and attracting a
        wider user base.

      <h3>Differentiation Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        Our differentiation strategy focused on incorporating innovative
        features that set our platform apart:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Maps API Integration:</strong> This feature allows
          users to search for rental properties based on location. By
          visualizing property locations on a map, users can easily identify
          rentals in their desired area, enhancing the overall user experience
          and making the platform more intuitive to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Individual Property Pages:</strong> Each property has a
          dedicated page providing detailed information and reviews. This
          approach ensures that users can get a comprehensive view of potential
          rental options, including amenities, nearby facilities, and honest
          feedback from previous tenants.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Main Design Decisions</h2>

      <h3>Simplicity</h3>
      <p>
        We prioritized simplicity in our design to ensure a user-friendly
        experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean and Minimalist Main Page:</strong> Our main page
          features a prominent search bar at the top, allowing users to quickly
          access property listings. The layout is clean, with ample white space
          to avoid clutter and confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intuitive Navigation Bar:</strong> We included a thematic
          photo to create visual interest and establish brand identity, along
          with a straightforward navigation bar that guides users to different
          sections of the site seamlessly.
        </li>
      </ul>
