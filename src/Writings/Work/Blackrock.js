      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Starting January 2025, this internship at Blackrock Neurotech in Salt
        Lake City, Utah, will focus on designing and optimizing user interaction
        models for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The role involves
        conducting user research, usability testing, and collaborating with
        engineers and researchers to integrate user-centered design solutions
        into advanced neurotechnology applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Interaction Model Design:</strong>
          Develop and optimize user interaction models for BCI systems, with a
          strong emphasis on usability and accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Research and Usability Testing:</strong>
          Conduct research and usability testing to gather insights and refine
          interaction models, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative Development:</strong>
          Work closely with engineers and researchers to integrate design
          solutions into cutting-edge neurotechnology, bridging the gap between
          user needs and technical functionality.
