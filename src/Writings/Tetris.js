<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Tetris-inspired iOS game combines the familiar mechanics of Tetris with the geometric challenges of Tangrams. Players drag, rotate, and snap Tetris pieces to fit them into templates, solving puzzles in a visually captivating space-themed environment.</p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <p>To ensure optimal performance, the game requires an iPhone updated to at least iOS 15. It is developed using Swift Language 5.6 and Xcode version 13.3.1.</p>

    <h2>Key Steps in the Design Process</h2>

    <h3>Competitor Research</h3>
    <p>I began the project by conducting thorough research on existing Tetris and Tangram-inspired games to understand market trends and user preferences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Identified popular games and analyzed their design, gameplay mechanics, and user reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> Tested various similar products to identify features that resonated with users and pinpointed areas for improvement. I noted common user complaints about outdated graphics, lack of innovative gameplay, and limited visual feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Concept Exploration</h3>
    <p>I explored various design directions for the game's main page and overall aesthetic:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wireframes and Sketches:</strong> Developed wireframes and sketches to visualize different design concepts. This initial exploration included various themes and layout options to determine the most engaging and intuitive design.</li>
        <li><strong>Demo Versions:</strong> Created three simple demo versions with different themes to gauge user preferences. The team unanimously selected a 3D space theme for its uniqueness and visual appeal, as it provided a captivating backdrop for the puzzle-solving experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Main Design Decisions</h2>

    <h3>Puzzle Piece Design</h3>
    <p>I focused on enhancing the visual clarity and aesthetic appeal of the puzzle pieces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3D Perspectives and Shadowing:</strong> Experimented with various shadowing and 3D perspectives to add depth to the puzzle pieces. This approach improved visual clarity, making it easier for players to distinguish and manipulate pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Testing:</strong> Tested different design combinations to ensure that the pieces were not only visually appealing but also functional and easy to use during gameplay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
    <p>I carefully selected a color scheme that would enhance the game's space-themed environment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Galaxy-inspired Colors:</strong> Chose a black background with vibrant, galaxy-inspired colors to create an immersive space atmosphere. The color palette included hues reminiscent of cosmic phenomena, such as nebulae and stars, to create a visually stunning environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Feedback</h3>
    <p>To enhance player engagement and satisfaction, I incorporated dynamic visual feedback:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celebratory Elements:</strong> Designed celebratory visual elements, such as splashing fire effects in the background, to reward players upon successfully completing each puzzle. This provided a sense of accomplishment and excitement.</li>
        <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Added animations simulating a rocket launching into space, further enhancing the sense of achievement and immersion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As the main UX/UI designer and developer, I led the design and development process. My responsibilities included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted research to gather insights into user preferences and behaviors, informing the design process.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireframes and Mockups:</strong> Created detailed wireframes, sketches, and high-fidelity mockups to visualize the game's user interface and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Implemented the game's user interface and visual elements using Swift and Xcode, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <h3>Initial Concepts</h3>
    <p>I explored initial concepts and ideas through a combination of paper wireframes and digital prototypes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paper Wireframes:</strong> Sketched out initial ideas to quickly iterate and refine design concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Prototypes:</strong> Developed digital prototypes to test and visualize the user interface and interactions. These prototypes helped me identify potential usability issues early in the design process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
    <p>I created high-fidelity mockups to refine the visual design and layout:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Paid close attention to typography, spacing, and imagery to ensure a polished and cohesive aesthetic. The high-fidelity mockups included detailed representations of the game's interface, puzzle pieces, and background elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Incorporated interactive elements into the mockups to demonstrate the game's drag, rotate, and snap mechanics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>Conducted usability testing sessions to evaluate the game's design and user experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testing Sessions:</strong> Engaged college students and other potential users to test the game. These sessions provided valuable insights into how users interacted with the game and their overall experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Collected feedback on usability, visual design, and overall satisfaction. Based on this feedback, I identified minor issues related to development and coding, which were addressed in subsequent iterations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Designs</h2>
    <p>Incorporated feedback from usability testing to refine the final designs. The game features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Engaging 3D Visuals:</strong> Immersive space-themed visuals and animations that captivate players.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Mechanics:</strong> Responsive drag, rotate, and snap interactions that make puzzle-solving enjoyable and intuitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrant Colors and Visual Feedback:</strong> A color palette that enhances the space theme and celebratory visual feedback that rewards players, enhancing their overall satisfaction and enjoyment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>The project provided valuable lessons in game design and user experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Importance of Usability Testing:</strong> Conducting usability testing was crucial in identifying potential issues and ensuring a user-friendly experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Design Process:</strong> Iterative design allowed me to continuously refine and improve the game based on user feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Attention to Visual Detail:</strong> A focus on visual detail and dynamic feedback significantly enhanced player engagement and satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
